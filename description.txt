Speeds up the process of creating potions by increasing the amount of potions recieved through crafting recipes. The mod uses a configurable multiplier value to do this. There's also an option to remove bottles or bottles of water from crafting recipes to streamline things even further.

Compatible with modded potions, as long as it makes the drinking noise when consumed, OR it has "Potion" in the item name.
